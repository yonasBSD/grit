//! Embedder-facing transfer (fetch / push) result & option types, plus the
//! negotiation-driven pack builder.
//!
//! This module is the foundation for the in-process fetch/push APIs that
//! embedders such as `jj` and GitButler consume in place of `gix` transport.
//! It defines the structured input/output types those APIs use and implements
//! the single most important primitive — [`build_pack`] — which packs **only**
//! the objects reachable from a negotiated set of `wants` and not already
//! reachable from the remote's `haves`.
//!
//! Scope note (phase 1): only the local / `file://` object+ref copy path is in
//! scope. `git://`, `http(s)`, and `ssh` transports plus credential-helper
//! execution are out of scope and are left as TODOs in later phases.
//!
//! Push *result* reporting reuses [`crate::push_report::PushRefResult`] /
//! [`crate::push_report::PushRefStatus`] rather than redefining it.
