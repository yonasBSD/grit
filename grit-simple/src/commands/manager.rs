//! `gs manager` — a Git credential helper backed by the Windows Credential
//! Manager.
//!
//! Git for Windows ships Git Credential Manager (the `manager` helper), but it
//! is only present when Git for Windows is installed. `gs manager` provides the
//! same capability built into `gs` itself: it speaks Git's credential-helper
//! protocol (`get` / `store` / `erase`) on stdin/stdout, storing secrets
//! directly in the Windows Credential Manager. `gs auth` wires `credential.helper`
//! to it automatically on Windows when nothing else is configured.
//!
//! You don't normally run this yourself — Git (and `gs`) invoke it. On
//! non-Windows platforms the command exists but errors, since there is no
//! Windows Credential Manager to talk to.
